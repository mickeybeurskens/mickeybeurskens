# ⚡ Behold the power of Software ⚡!
Hi, I'm Mickey, a developer and software engineer interested in the full stack of software possibilities.

I've worked as an Artificial Intelligence engineer and loved to tinker with the software side of things in 🐍 Python 🐍.
Now I'm learning React, Nodejs and other web related technologies through [this course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) hosted by the University of Hellsinky 🕸️. You can find my repository [here](https://github.com/mickeybeurskens/fullstackopen-course).

Feel free to contact me at `info@mickeybeurskens.nl` or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickey-beurskens/).
